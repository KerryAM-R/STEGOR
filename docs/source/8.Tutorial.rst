Video Tutorial 
==============

This section will include access to a test datasest to learn how to use STEGO.R. 

This will include the video tutorials. 

Datasets
--------

Tutorial directory (https://zenodo.org/records/12665808) that contains the melanoma dataset with the lymph node and tumor single cell sample. 


The T cell atlas V2 (https://zenodo.org/records/12569981) will be used to demonstrate some of the functionality in Step 4. Analysis and post-analysis section. 

Quality control (Steps 1 to 3)
------------------------------

If you already have an .rds seurat object, and the TCR data was processed with scRepertoire proceed to Step 3e. to reformat the meta-data and then step 3c (annotation) and 3d (option).
