Step 4. Analysis
================
.. note::

    Under active construction
    
    This section will include example analyses depending on the type of data present.




Application structure
---------------------
The analysis section is divided into several sub-sections. 

- Uploaded files
- Overview 
- TCR -> GEX 
- Automation (TCR -> GEx)
- GEx -> TCR

Uploaded files
--------------

There first tab will show in the side panel the files that can be uploaded. 

Side bar
^^^^^^^^

To streamline the analysis, for this section you will only see the following:

.. image:: img/4_files_to_upload.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Alternative text

This will include the following default files that can be uploaded: 
- Upload seurat file (.rds)
- Upload AG clusTCR2 file (.csv)
- Upload BD clusTCR2 file (.csv)
- Upload TCRex (.tsv)

To make selecting the "**Data source**" and "**Species**", there are functions to identify if the TCR-seq formattting is AIRR or not. The species is currently either human (hs) or mouse (mm) and based on the gene formatting of all caps (hs) or proper case (mm). The latter is needed as R is a case sensative language. 

If you need additional identifiers for the analysis section, this can be added by switching "add additional labels" to "yes" and upload the "Update_labels.csv". The file consists of the first column labelled as "ID" must not be changed. This first column must match the unique identifiers used in the "Sample_Name" column for ease of use. The user can add as many columns. Any special characters will be convered to either .  or _. An example is given with the colitis dataset that has three broad categories under the condition column. The user can then add additional variables that could be used for analysis.This was added to the analysis section, so the user does not have to go back to Step 1, and is also restrictive to one unique label.

    :class: longtable



Main panel 
^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on what you have uploaded, the main panel will render several tables. The first table is of the Seurat object's meta-data and you will see how it adds the additional labels after the "Sample_Name" column. 

Uploaded example of the colitis complication to melanoma therapy dataset (GSE144469)

Side bar (Analysis sections)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The side bar has variables that may be relevant to the all analyses, or only a specific section. 

The variables common to the analysis section include:

- V gene with/without CDR3
- Selected Sample
- restricing to one sample for filtering purposes
- colouring 
- Plotting parameter (e.g., text size)
- Legend parameters

Overview
--------

The purpose of this section was to be able to interrogate the overview of the GEx only population dynamics regardless of TCR-seq and visa versa with TCR-seq only. 


Side bar (OV only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two aspects that are specific to the overview section that includes splitting the graphs based on the "selected sample", adn in the TCR section for colouring by the binned clone counts, clone frequency or top expanded clones.

main panel (OV)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The GEx section contains the following subs


The side bar contains several reactive variables that can be used for the various analyses. 






The selected individuals = Sample Name (default)

Display by Selected Individual = no or yes. This is linked to the "Selected Individual" button. 

Number of plot row  = 2. This allows the user to select the number of rows to display as desired.

The "Split graph by:" button allows for some graphs e.g., Pie charts, to be split by this variable rather than the "Selected Individual"

.. image:: img/4_display-graph.png
  :width: 300

The user can also select which variable to colour the graphs by with "Colour by:" 

Additionally, the uder can also select the colouring Palettes that includes: "default", "rainbow", "random", "heat.colors", "terrain.colors", "topo.colors", "hcl.colors", "one"

The "one" colour is linked to the "One colour". Additionally all NA variable will be coloured the light grey #E5E5E5

For some of the functions, the user can restrict to "What individuals to include"

This includes both the 
- "Display one individual?"
- "Display one individual"

For instance this is used to filter the TCR table in the clonal abudance section to more easily identify the most abundant cloens relative to a specific sample/individual based on the "selected individuals" button.

The user can also select the plot parameters that are relevant to the majority of the graphs

This includes:
    - Axis number size - size of the numbered axis
    - Axis text size i.e., axis title
    - Legend text size
    - legend location (left, right, top, bottom or none)
    - Type of Font

Overview
^^^^^^^^
- GEx
    - Percentage (Table)
    - UMAP of the annotation models
    - Pie chart
- TCR
    - UPSET plot (<31)
    - Line graph (clone tracking)
    - expansion (bar) 
    - expansion (UMAP)

TCR-seq -> GEX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each section has a summary table, UMAP, Heatmap, stats, dot-plot and over-representation.

Some of the secions also have unique features.

- Clonal abudance
    - Bar graph 
    - Ridge and Violin plots (for a specific gene)
- Exapanded
- ClusTCR
    - Motif 
- Epitope 
    - Load Epitope list 

Automation (TCR -> GEX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Clonotype 
    - Download public (bar graphs), summary table, dot plot for each public-like clone
    - Download private (single sample)
    - Can restrict based on the calculated priority 1/(sample total * total count)
    
- Cluster 
    - Download the motif, summary table, dot plot for each public-like and private clusters
        - A common cluster is TRAV1-2 TRAJ33 
        - separate alpha and beta cut-offs
    - Priority: 1/(number of nodes * sample total * total count)

- Epitope/Annotation
    - with the epitopes find the associated epitopes from TCRex 
    - Unselect "Add in Epitope data" to focus on the annotations. So, you can identify the TCR linked to specific annotation models (e.g., FunctionTcell)

GEx -> TCR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Annotation
    - Under development 

- Marker 
    - Single marker
    - Dual marker 


Example 1. Colitis dataset
--------------------------

In the zenodo repository we have uploaded the colitis dataset. This consis of 32 samples in the colitis dataset with the additon of the background data.
